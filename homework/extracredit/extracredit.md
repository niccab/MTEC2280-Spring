Extra Credit

I went to the "Make Pictures" Exhibition hosted by GIPHY, where 4 different web-based drawing / animation tools were presented within the bitforms gallery. 

"Boopy" by Andrew Benson, https://boopy.club
I had the most fun with this one (see attached video). You were able to "scrub in" select portions of the camera feed, which would then play back as a loop. You could keep scrubbing in different portions and create layers of segmented feeds.

"Eyemall" by Withering Systems, https://eyemall.biz
Using the GIPHY database, users were allowed to assemble a skeleton by selecting different gifs to compose the head, hands, knees, lips, etc. 

"Sketch Machine" by Casey Reas, https://sketchmachine.net/
With Casey Reas being one of Processing's father, I had the highest expectations for this piece only to fall a bit short. With this site, you can create short animations in a paint-like drawing app, however some key controls required a keyboard, but there was no keyboard present in the install.

"Extinctr" by Harm van den Dorpel, https://extinctr.com
This site transforms any small sized imported image into a slowly dissolving mound of pixels.
