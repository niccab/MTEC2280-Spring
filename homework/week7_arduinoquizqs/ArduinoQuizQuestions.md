Arduino Quiz Questions

#1
Out of 6 LEDs, make a random LED light up. Depending on which LED is lit (first to sixth), times that by 1000 to create a corresponding delay value that controls the tone on the speaker. Have the tone last 3 seconds each time.

#2
Using a potentiometer, use mapped value to control the length of time for the "speaker laser" tone. (modify in-class exercise)

#3
Use 2 potentiometers to control:
- how many LEDs are on
- how fast those LEDs are blinking
